## About Project

Clone of Netflix website built using React JS and designed using Tailwind CSS. Website is fully responsive and uses reusable components that take certain props. Website is based on fetching data using Axios from TMDb API. All of the rows are generated by a single fetch request that gets fetch URL from Row component props. Movies placed in given categories can be scrolled through using Swiper. The website allows signing in and signing up. On top of that, signed in users can mark videos as liked and get access to the Account page, which features videos they have liked. Movies shown in the Account page can also be scrolled through using Swiper and can also get deleted from the liked movies list. All these functionalities are supported with Firebase.
